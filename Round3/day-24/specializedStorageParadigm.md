## Specialized Storage Paradigm 

**Blob Storaged** A blob (Binary Large Object) consists of binary data stored as a single item. While data can be of any type, blob storage is particularly useful for storing media, such as audio and video, and frequently changing data, such as log files.

**Time Serie Database** A time series database (TSDB) is a database optimized for time-stamped or time series data. Time series data are simply measurements or events that are tracked, monitored, downsampled, and aggregated over time. This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data, events, clicks, trades in a market, and many other types of analytics data.

**Graph Database** A graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables, or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard.

**Cypher** Cypher is Neo4jâ€™s graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph. It is like SQL for graphs, and was inspired by SQL so it lets you focus on what data you want out of the graph (not how to go get it). It is the easist graph language to learn by far because of its similarity to other languages, and intuitiveness.

**Spatial Database** A spatial database is a database that is enhanced to store and access spatial data or data that defines a geometric space. These data are often associated with geographic locations and features or constructed features like citie

**Quadtree** A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most ...
