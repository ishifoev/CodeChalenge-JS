## Configuration

The config file is like the genome of a computer application; it stores parameters that define your system's critical settings, much like your DNA stores the genes that define your physical characteristics.
Unlike its biological counterpart though, the config file is easily editable. No gene therapy needed!

**JSON** A file format heavily used in API and configuration. Stands of Javascript Object Notation exmaple: 
````json
 {
   "version": 1.0,
   "name": "AlgoExpert Configuration"
 }
````

**YAML** A file format used in configuration

````yaml
