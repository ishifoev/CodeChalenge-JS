***Latency*** The time it takes for a certain operations to complete in system. Most often a measure time duration like mileseconds or seconds. You should know this orders of magnitude:
* ***Reading 1MB from RAM*** 0,25 ms
* ***Reading 1MB from SSD*** 1ms
* ***Transfer 1MB over the network*** 10MS
* ***Reading 1MB from HDD*** 20MS
* ***InterContinental round trip*** 150MS

***Throughput*** The number of operations that system can handle properly per time unit. For instance the throughtput can be measured in request per second(RPS or QPS)
