## Logging And Monitoring

In order to properly understand and diagnose issues that crop up within a system, itâ€™s critical to have mechanisms in place that create audit trails of various events that occur within
said system. So go ahead, unleash your inner Orwell and go full Big Brother on your application.

**Logging**
The act of collecting and storing logs--useful information about events in your system.
Typically your programs will output log messages to its STDOUT or STDERR pipes, which
will automatically get aggregated into a centralized logging solution.

**Monitoring**
The process of having visibility into a system's key metrics, monitoring is typically
implemented by collecting important events in a system and aggregating them in humanreadable charts.
