## Hashing

**Hashing function** A function that makes specific data type(such a string or identifier) and outputs a number. Differents inputs may have the same output, but good hashing function attempts to minimize those hashing collisions which is equivalent to maximizing to uniformity.

**Load Balancer** A type of reverse proxy that distrubutes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be found in many part of the system from the DNS layer all the way to the database layer.
