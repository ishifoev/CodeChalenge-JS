## Availability 

**Availability** The odds of particular service being up and running at any point in time, usually measured in percentages. A server that has 99% availability will be operation 99% time(this would described as having two nine of availability)

**High availability** Used to describe system that have a particularly high level of availability, typically 5 nines of more; sometimes abbreviated HA

**Nines** Typically refers to percentages of uptime. For example five nine of availability means uptime of 99.999% the time. Below are the downtimes expected per year depending on 9s

* 99%(two 9s): 87.7 hours
* 99.9%(three 9s): 8.8 hours
* 99.99%: 52.46 minutes
* 99.999%: 5.3 minutes

**Redundancy** The process of replicating parts of system in an effort to more reliable.

**SLA** Short for service level agreement, an SLA is a collection of guarentees given to customer by a service provider. SLA typically make guarentees on a system availablity amonst other things. SLA made up one or multiple SLO

**SLO** Short for service level objective an SLO is a guarentee give to customer by a service provider. SLO typically make guarentees on a system availability amongst other things. SLO constitute an SLA.
